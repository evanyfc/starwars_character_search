starwars character search
==

A simple character search based on SWAPI (https://swapi.co)

Goal is allow the user to:

1. type in search query and see results returned
2. see how many results were returned from search query
3. filter down results from API by gender_selection

Known issues:

* ~~Need to allow gender filter go back to "all"~~
* Show number of results for each gender in the select dropdown
